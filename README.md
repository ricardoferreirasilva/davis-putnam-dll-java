This program was written by Ricardo SÃ¡ Loureiro Ferreira da Silva,
a Computer Science student in the Faculty of Sciences, University of Oporto, Portugal.
This program was written in Java and its goal is
to implement a variant of the original Davis-Putnam algorithm from 1960 [DP60,DLL62].
I will try to briefly describe what each function does in the comments.
  
Feel free to use my code for projects and learning. If someone happens to do it I would
appreciate to be given credit.
  
Any questions ask away,
Thanks
Ricardo Ferreira da Silva
